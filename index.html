                <h2>1. Preface</h2>
                <h2>2. The Character</h2>
                    <h3>2.1 Attributes</h3>
                        <b>Strength</b>
                        <p>Used whenever a character must use feats of strength or power. For example, moving large 
                        objects, kicking open a locked door, pulling up a load attached by rope from a well, climbing a 
                        rocky cliffside, etc.</p>
                        <b>Constitution</b>
                        <p>Represents the character’s resistance towards physical damage. For example, you get 
                        bludgeoned by a warhammer, then, based on your constitution, the damage you sustain will be 
                        lowered (or increased if your constitution is low). Constitution also determines character’s 
                        maximum health.</p>
                        <b>Willpower</b>
                        <p>Represents the character’s resistance towards magical damage. For example, a powerful wizard 
                        attempts to steal your sanity, however you have a high willpower and are able to resist his 
                        attack. Willpower also determines the character’s maximum spirit.</p>
                        <b>Intelligence</b>
                        <p>Used when the character is attempted to absorb knowledge or be intuitive. For example, the 
                        character is locked in a room with a single door as the exit. If he is aware that the door is 
                        trapped (see Awareness), then his intelligence would allow him to disarm the trap.</p>
                        <b>Speed</b>
                        <p>Used when the character must be fast or agile. For example, if the character opens a large 
                        stone door only to trigger its trap -- the floor collapses to an underground cavern -- his speed 
                        would allow him to try and quickly move to another part of the floor before he falls in.</p>
                        <b>Charisma</b>
                        <p>Used to determine the likability of the character. For example, if a character is trying to 
                        barter for a sword at a local weapons shop, his charisma might allow him to get it for cheaper 
                        if he seems friendly and polite to the shopkeep.</p>
                        <b>Awareness</b>
                        <p>Used to see if the character notices certain things. For example, if the character is 
                        searching a room for a special item, his awareness would tip him off to the location of the item.</p>
